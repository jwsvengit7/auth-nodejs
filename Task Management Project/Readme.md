## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

The MediGuard backend serves as the core of the MediGuard application, providing functionalities related to user management, patient records, task management, and more. It is designed to handle user authentication, data storage, and communication with the frontend.

### Architecture Overview

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js with Typescript, with MongoDB as the database for storing user and application data. It follows a modular architecture, separating routes, models, middleware, and utilities for better maintainability and scalability.

## 2. Getting Started

### Installation

To install and set up the MediGuard backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd MediGuard-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file (refer to `.env.example` for required variables).

### Running the Backend

To start the backend server, run:

```
npm start
```

## 3. API Documentation

### Authentication and Authorization

All requests to the backend APIs require authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). To obtain a JWT, users need to register or login.

**Authentication Middleware:** Ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes.

**Authorization Middleware:** Checks if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.

### Endpoints

The API provides various endpoints for user management, patient operations, task management, and more. Refer to the detailed API documentation for a complete list of endpoints and their functionalities.

#### User Registration

Endpoint: `POST /api/users/register`

Description: Registers a new user.

Request Body:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  ...
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": { ... },
  "token": "your-jwt-token"
}
```

## 4. Models

The backend uses various models to structure and store data. Refer to the documentation for details on each model's fields and relationships.

### User Model

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "hashed-password",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  ...
}
```

### Patient Model

```json
{
  "name": "Patient Name",
  "gender": "Male",
  "age": 35,
  ...
}
```

Continue the documentation by filling in details for other sections, expanding the API documentation, providing usage examples, and addressing common issues.

Remember that this is just a template. You should tailor the documentation to your specific backend's functionalities, requirements, and best practices.
